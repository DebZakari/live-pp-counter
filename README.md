## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to ultimately further myself into the world of web development. I wanted to learn frontend, backend, automation, web scraping and I figured this is the best way for me to do it.

This is also greatly motivated by the fact that there is an on-going fierce battle among the top players of osu!, and I want to document this battle in a live platform like YouTube where players can comment their thoughts, very much like the battle between PewDiePie vs T-Series.

## Contributions
This project is entirely ideated by me, with the help of ChatGPT to get the concepts down.
